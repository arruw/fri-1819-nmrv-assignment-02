\section{Introduction}
In this exercise we had two tasks. First we had to implement Mean-Shift algorithm and test it on 2D intensity field with different parameters. And for the second one we had to implement Mean-Shift based tracker and test it on few VOT challenge datasets with different parameters.

\section{Mean-Shift}
Mean-Shift algorithm is used to iteratively find local maximum on some 2D intensity field from given starting point. Our task ware to implement it and find how different parameters effect conversion time (in steps) and accuracy.

\subsection{Implementation}
\subsection{Comparison}
We compared Mean-Shift algorithm on different Gaussian and Epanechnikov kernels, kernel sizes and starting locations.
